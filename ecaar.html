              <p>ECAAR’s branding utilizes the rubber duck, a Southeast-Asian symbol of freedom from autocracy, and the color yellow, referencing Yellow Peril. The design targets people of all backgrounds and ages. Colors are high contrast for visibility, and typefaces are sans-serif. ECAAR is student-run, so everything feels playful while still credible.

            <h3>Content-focused signatures</h3>
              <p>Because ECAAR creates educational resources, there are a couple of good reasons to create a watermark. First, watermarks prevent others from stealing design and research-based work from students of ECAAR. Second, watermarks create a universal brand identity across student-created work, which tends to vary in tone, aesthetic, and overall style.
                <br> <br>
                The watermark design aims to be iconic but not distracting and easy to add to any piece of work. As such, I worked with neutral colors and avoided designs that would require students to adjust opacity for use.

                <h3>Educating in the classroom and online</h3>
                <p>Part of our early philosophy for the club was to utilize design principles to educate people through social media. We taught members to use research, visual hierarchy, color, symbolism, and imagery to tackle important issues. Members of the “Instagraphic” squad conducted research on subjects they were passionate about and the audience was educated on those subjects. Eventually, we shifted towards more in-depth research and event planning, but still used social media as a primary medium through which to advertise.

                    <p>ECAAR’s early brand identity was a retro-inspired text treatment. While the lantern motif was interesting, the silhouette of the design was confusing. There were also too many colors, which led to issues with the cost of merchandise, printing, and brand cohesion.

We shifted instead to colorful graphics, taglines, practical deliverables, and action items.

                    <h3>Mercer Island's first night market</h3>
                    <p>A Taiwanese-inspired night market. Six local Asian-owned businesses and three non-profits sold products or entertained during the five-hour event. I was responsible for the design, advertising, financial management, and outreach for the night market. My goal was to bring diversity to my school and educate the community on a unique part of my culture, with the added benefit of helping promote local businesses.
                    <br> <br>
                    I designed all promotional materials and merchandise, including our event website: ecaarnightmarket.square.site. We promoted the event heavily on social media, especially through groups like the high school or local nonprofits.
                    <br> <br>
                    We had a total budget of $1980, with our goal being to break even. Over 700 people attended the event and participated in various cultural activities like Tinikling, a Filipino dance, or creating a wishing tree. This was double our attendance goal, and nearly every booth sold out of product within three or four hours. It was a very successful night: with donations, we made over $200 in profit for the club, and businesses were able to keep all of their respective profits.

                    <h3>A collaborative cookbook of family recipes</h3>
                    <p>I organized a team of 50 high school students in the Education Coalition for Asian American Representation (ECAAR), to design, write, and sell a 140-page multicultural Asian cookbook in 3 months. Our goal was to educate people on the history and cultural significance of foods from across Asia and bring representation to our community. I acted as the head organizer, designer, and editor for the project.
                    <br> <br>
                    There are 16 tested recipes from 10 different cultures all across Asia, each with six pages of information about the dish’s origin, personal anecdotes, and more. We aimed to sell 50 cookbooks for $25 each and exceeded our goal by nearly 300% (we sold 190 cookbooks, bringing in around $5000 in revenue).
