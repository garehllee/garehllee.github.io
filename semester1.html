          <h3>How can Design reconnect people with the intricacies of their surroundings?</h3>
          <p>We were tasked with designing a “Mindful Sensing Device” meant to re-awaken an assigned sense and enrich users’ understandings of the environments they inhabit. Designs were constrained to be made of string, brown paper, brown tape, wooden dowels, glue, and cardboard.</p>

          <h3>Final Deliverable</h3>
          <p>People typically focus on what is in front of them, especially with the advent of modern technology like phones and computers. The goal of my device is to amplify sound from behind its user and focus attention primarily on hearing.
            <br><br>The spherical dome structure aims to preserve sounds entering from the cone on the back while blocking other noises. The sphere also restricts vision and hand-holds occupy touch to reduce stimuli that can distract from hearing.

          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>I came up with three prototypes for the device. The two non-final designs included a rotating container that would create different noises depending on what went inside and a giant cone that amplified sound on one side of the user’s head.
          <br><br>Ultimately, I opted to go with the dome. After building cardboard prototypes, the container did not produce particularly interesting sounds, and the cone, while effective, did not feel as interesting as the dome. I also felt that I could merge the cone and dome ideas by putting a single large cone on the back of the dome rather than the two originally planned.

      </div>
      <div class="rightside">
        <div class="textspace">
          <p>In the final sketches, I enlarged the size of the dome and switched to just one cone. As a result of the larger dome, the device no longer fit on the user’s shoulders, so the final build has shoulder pads. Another modification was the addition of a dispersal cone inside of the dome to redisperse the sound captured by the large cone.
          <br><br>From this project, I learned the basics of design process, iteration, and sketching. If I could redo the final design, I would experiment with the shape of the dispersal cone to amplify the sound. I would also improve intuitive usability with the shape language of the shoulder pads and the form itself.

          <h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
          <p>For our final compositions, we were asked to use various mediums to explore diagrammatic, representational, expressive, and symbolic representations of our objects. I conducted research into the origins of my objects to inform relational charts.
            <br><br>Stick/stone/leaf was a wild, confusing ride. In one sense, I developed my intuitive and adaptive design instincts. The unit had relatively loose assignments that regularly forced me to use mediums that I was unfamiliar with. Similarly, while we were never taught composition, it became apparent that composition, even during ideation, is an important factor in fully communicating ideas. 
            <br><br>I think the most important takeaway from stick/stone/leaf was the development of sketching as a way to think. Just as authors use writing to work through their thoughts, designers draw to explore objects, forms, ideas, and more, developing stories for objects and adjusting ideas to best fit their appropriate use.

          <h3>How can we effectively communicate ideas through sketches?
          </h3>
          <p>We were taught the fundamentals of one-point and two-point perspective drawing, using cube and cylinder constructions to draw anything and everything from the infamous cubeville to exploding tops to giant hands.

          <p>Prior to this semester, I had only briefly touched upon perspective and I had not practiced it very much. I also do not have a strong fine-arts background, so drawing has always been challenging. Through this unit, I have become much more confident in my abilities and began to enjoy drawing a lot.
          <br><br>At first, we practiced a lot of cube drawing, then moved onto cylindrical forms. We practiced consistency by using unerasable mediums such as ball point pens, alcohol markers, and fineliners.

          <p>The bear model took a few iterations. We ultimately decided on a trapezoid shape language, which provided thematic contrast with our round fish and square fairy. The viewing hole had to be expanded several times, and the proportions of the head to the body were adjusted to be less intimidating. We chose colors based on their relation to one another as a large color scheme, opting for a darker, more neutral brown for the bear to highlight its purple plane and its contrast with the almost neon-colored fairy.
