              <h3>Personalized Screen Time for Phone Boundaries</h3>
              <p>Apple Screen Time aims to prevent phone overuse with reminders and restrictions. In practice, however, the system is easy to ignore, causes panic and irritation, and generally has minimal impact on phone usage. 
                <br><br>
                *The ideas in Screen Time 2.0 are conceptual and have not been implemented by Apple.

            <h3>Repurposing Underused Apple OS Systems</h3>
            <p>Many of Screen Time 2.0's mechanisms already exist on Apple devices. Screen Time 2.0 would take up minimal extra device storage and drive users towards device capabilities that currently serve little purpose, increasing investment in Apple infrastructure.         
            </p>
            <h3>Bolstering Public Trust</h3>
            <p>In a market dominated by fast trends, Apple can stand out by reaffirming its commitment to serve the public good, simplicity, and excellence. Giving users an option to build healthier boundaries with their devices creates lasting trust and opens a market to those who wish to be connected digitally, but not all of the time.</p>

Apple Screen Time is the most popular option, likely because of its convenience and cross-device coverages.

                    <p>Taking notes on popular Screen Time apps allowed the adaptation of great features and reworking of not-so-great features. Based on competitive research, Screen Time 2.0 aims to do the following:
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Broad Appeal:</span> Screen Time 2.0 does not aim to do everything, and leaves niche features like One Sec’s deep breath for external apps. Since Screen Time 2.0 would be built into IOS, potentially irritating features should be avoided.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Data Analysis:</span> Screen Time is unique in that it tracks screen usage, which in itself helps people see where they can improve. No other application does this, giving Screen Time a competitive edge.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Full Device Control:</span> Since most apps are limited in their scope, users can readily bypass screen time services. IOS-focused design allows for multiple intervention points.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Simplicity:</span> Although Screen Time 2.0 can be somewhat complex, setting it up should be simple and its features should be easily understandable. Services like Stay Focused are effective, but require so much set up that users rarely reap the benefits it has to offer.

                    <h3>How Might We Use Self-Awareness and Avoid Reactance to Nudge People Away from Screen Usage?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Analyzing survey responses and competitive research led to brainstorming issues for Screen Time 2.0 to solve. Pain Points are user-response-based, whereas Key Issues bring in psychological research and more generalized problems with phone usage.

                        Key Insights:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Bypassing Screen Time Requires Context and Freedom.</span> Users dislike being completely locked out of an application. To avoid panic, reminders leading up to disabling an application and adding context, alternatives, and reminders to the restriction itself helps users make a more informed decision.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Screen Time Doesn’t Adapt to Users’ Needs.</span> Most of the time, people are not looking for a highly restrictive, nor highly lax screen time service. People wish to stay connected to friends, and want screen time to respect their screen needs. Essentially, screen time should be more of an assistant than a commander.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Perceived Complexity Leads to Minimal Usage.</span> The more complicated it is to understand what screen time is doing, the less it will be used. A solution should balance complexity with effectiveness.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Guilt and Force Don't Work.</span> Making users feel guilty for using an app, or completely blocking an app, leads to frustration and the turning-off of screen time services.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Phones Numb Emotions.</span> The reason phones are addictive is that they allow people to escape to their digital world. Screen Time often does not address this need, and solutions should encourage boundary-setting with devices, especially at key moments like before bed or in the morning.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Losing Track of Time is Easy.</span> When scrolling through social media, playing a game, or consuming content, it is easy to forget how long it has been. Gentle reminders help break this pattern.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="p-emphasis">Best Phone Features Should Stay Available.</span> Emergency and location services, messaging, and phone calls should rarely be restricted. The user’s safety should always come first.

                              To avoid decision fatigue, Standard mode is the “always-on” mode, and if users wish, Productivity and Social modes are easily available on the Screen Time widget. Wind Down, Sleep, and Wake Up activate automatically based on time of day. Any Screen Time mode can be scheduled ahead in Calendar. Cheat Day is meant to build healthy phone boundaries by only being available when scheduled 12 hours ahead.

                    <p>First off, if you've scrolled this far, thanks! Beyond building this project into actual IOS, the project could readily be expanded to MacOS and other device systems. Similar Screen Time ideas can be implemented across Androids and similar devices. In particular, time-of-day-based screen time services, especially morning services, were the most popular of the proposed Screen Time 2.0 features.
